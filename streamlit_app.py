The Bonn dataset is a popular benchmark dataset for EEG-based seizure detection and epilepsy diagnosis. 
It was introduced in 2001 by Ralph Andrzejak and colleagues from the University of Bonn, Germany.

**Dataset Overview**

The Bonn dataset consists of 5 sets (A-E) of EEG recordings, each containing 100 single-channel EEG segments of 23.6 seconds duration. 
The recordings were obtained from 5 different groups:

* **Set A**: Healthy volunteers
* **Set B**: Epileptic patients in the seizure-free interval
* **Set C**: Epileptic patients during a seizure
* **Set D**: Epileptic patients in the seizure-free interval, but with seizure activity in other brain areas
* **Set E**: Epileptic patients during a seizure, but with artifacts

The EEG signals were recorded using a 128-channel EEG system, but only a single channel (the Cz electrode) is provided in the dataset. 
The sampling rate is 173.61 Hz.

For more information about the Bonn dataset, please refer to the [original paper](https://www.upf.edu/documents/229517819/232450661/Andrzejak-PhysicalReviewE2001.pdf/0e9a54b8-8993-b400-743e-4d64fa29fb63) by Andrzejak et al.

**App Overview**

This app is designed to explore the Bonn dataset, visualize the EEG signals, extract features, and train a classifier for seizure detection.

In this app, you can:
* Explore the dataset and visualize the EEG signals
* Extract features from the EEG signals
* Train a classifier for seizure detection
* Evaluate the performance of the classifier
